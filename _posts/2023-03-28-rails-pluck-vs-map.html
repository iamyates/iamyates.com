</p>
<p>pluck:&#160; pick 1 attribute from array</p>
<p>map: re-implement your function</p>
<p>my_array.map(&amp;:id)</p>
<p>my_array.pluck(:id)&#160;</p>
<p>the same.&#160; pluck faster than map</p>
<pre>XXTransaction Pluck (0.3ms)  SELECT "xx_transactions"."id" FROM "xx_transactions" WHERE "xx_transactions"."id" = $1  [["id", 18068574]]
XXTransaction Load (0.5ms)  SELECT "xx_transactions".* FROM "xx_transactions" WHERE "xx_transactions"."id" = $1  [["id", 18068574]]
</pre>
